Part I

Step 1: Research what are exponentiation, square root and modulo operations for JavaScript
Step 2: Results of research (exponentiation = " base ** exponent ", square root = " Math.sqrt() ", modulo = " dividend % divisor ")
Step 3: Use the same logic applying the new operations as the previous four endpoints
Step 4: Create endpoints for the three new operations and run them
Step 5: When no faults are coming back, apply error handling logic to those three endpoints which I found that square root cannot be processed with a negative number
Step 6: Insert appropriate error handling into squareroot endpoint
Step 7: Run the app again with error handling tests
Step 8: If no faults are coming back, the calculator should be able to run 7 dtypes of arithmetic operations

Part II

Step 1: Research the needed content for document
Step 2: Create the document titled "SIT737 4.2c Part II"
Step 3: Insert neccessary content into document
Step 4: Use APA7 Referencing from Deakin page for references
Step 5: Insert completed document into GitHub Repo
